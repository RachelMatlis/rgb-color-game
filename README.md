<h1>RGB COLOR GAME</h1>
<h3>Improve Your RGB Colors Skills While Playing the RGB-Color-Game.</h3>

<p> I made the game by using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
The user has to match RGB numbers with the correct colored square displayed below by clicking on it. 
Users can choose to play on easy mode, hard mode or super-hard mode.</p>
